## State of the Yield Curve
I built this application because I wanted a simple way to know whether the US Treasury Yield Curve was inverted or not on any given day (this wasn't easily available at the time). As I built it out I added additional features including more comprehensive insight into not just whether it was inverted, but also how and to what extent and a drill down which shows the history of specific yield comparisons.

*This application was originally hosted at StateOfTheYieldCurve.com, but has since been taken down. See the app running in the demo video above.*

## Run it Locally

This is a simple Django application, so if you're familiar with the Django framework feel free to fork the repo and load it up locally (should be easy).

If you aren't familiar with Django, or run into any issues, feel free to reach out and I can help you get it set up.

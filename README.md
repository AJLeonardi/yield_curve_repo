# State of the Yield Curve
In mid-2019 there was a lot of discussion about the yield curve as a predictor of recession, but there was no simple way to see the current state of the yield curve (aside from websites geared towards finance experts). To satisfy my own curiosity about the daily status and historical trends of the yield curve, I created a web application, built with django, which provided a simple visual representation of the daily yield curves with the ability to also drill down into historical trends.
